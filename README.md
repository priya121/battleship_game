# battleship_game

This is a battleship game on a 10 by 10 grid. 

There are 5 different types of ships placed randomly by the computer vertically and horizontally on the grid when the game starts.

The user has to guess the coordinates on the grid where they think there is a ship. (A1 - J10)

Each time they hit all the coordinates for one ship this is displayed on the screen. eg. You sunk a destroyer.

Once they have guessed all the correct coordinates and hit all the ships they have won and the game exits.
